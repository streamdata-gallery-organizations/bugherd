description: BugHerd is the world&#8217;s simplest bug tracker for web designers and
  their clients. It embeds directly into a website so bugs are flagged and managed
  visually without the need to fill out lengthy forms. BugHerd also lets your client
  and stakeholders log bugs visually right from within your website or web application.
  They never have to switch into another app, and it&#8217;s easier and faster than
  sending an email.
